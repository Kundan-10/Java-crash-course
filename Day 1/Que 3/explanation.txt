Thread Safety: StringBuffer is designed to be thread-safe. It achieves this by synchronizing access to its methods. In the provided example, when multiple threads concurrently attempt to append characters to the StringBuffer, synchronization ensures that only one thread can access the append() method at a time. This prevents race conditions and ensures that the appending is done safely, without corrupting the internal state of the StringBuffer.
